Description: This is an easy-to-use package for inferring miRNA-mRNA interactions with an emphasis on predicting miRNA targets in an individual sample. 
             It integrates both sequence-based and expression-based information in target prediciton. The sequencing matching scores for all putative
	     miRNA-mRNA pairs are collected from TargetScan V7.0 (i.e., cumulative weighted context++ scores) and provided beforehand. The users only
	     need to provide the paired miRNA-mRNA expression profiles of the biological samples that they are interested in. Then it outputs the top
	     interactions rank ordered by miRACLe score at both the individual and population levels (if more than one samples are included) as the 
	     final prediction results.
